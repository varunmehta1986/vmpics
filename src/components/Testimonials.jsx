                                and reasonably priced photographer to capture some family photos.
                                We contacted Varun who did a wonderful job and captured some beautiful shots for us.
                                He was at the decided place on time and was very patient and accommodating.
                                He had some ideas of how the photos could be clicked and discussed it with us and took our inputs as well.
                                We loved the outcome and the photos. Thanks a lot Varun! <br /><br />

                                We booked Varun for our maternity Photoshoot.
                                He understands client's comfort and their preference. He made our shoot not some 60 min time slot but
                                a wonderfull and memorable experience.
                                Their is no doubt that he captures the best golden hours pictures and the location is stunning.
                                Also not to forget we got our gallery delivered within a week.
                                We can't wait to book Varun for more upcoming events. <br /><br />
