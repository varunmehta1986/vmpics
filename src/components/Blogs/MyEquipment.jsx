                        There are so many options available in the market today, that it's very east for a newbie will get lost to what
                        equipment to go for and which one takes the best photos.
                        There is DSLR and mirrorless that are either crop sensor or full frame.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I don't want to get into the details of them technology wise but they are all good cameras.
                        As they say - "a camera is as good as the photographer". You can achieve great results with most of the modern cameras.

                    <p>
                        Like many(read almost all) others,  I started my photography journey as a hobby and didn't want to to spend too much.
                        I purchased my first crop sensor DSLR,
                        a <a href='https://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/product-archive/dslr-cameras/d7100.html'>
                            Nikon D7100</a> in 2016 and a <a href='https://www.jbhifi.com.au/products/nikon-af-s-dx-nikkor-35mm-f-1-8g-lens'>
                            35mm Nikon prime lens </a> which is around 52mm on crop sensor D7100.
                        Why I started with Nikon? I just had a bad experience with Canon point and shoot i bought in 2012,
                        but DSLR/Mirrorless is a different ball game and I was too naive to understand that at that time.

                        And that is all I had for a very long time(4 years). After I moved to Australia,
                        I started doing professional shoots with that body and lens only and it worked alright for some time.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As my clientele started to grow and the variety of shoots, I started to realize the limitations of having a single fixed focal length lens.
                        So next, I bought full frame body
                        <a href='https://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/product/dslr-cameras/d750.html'>Nikon D750 </a>
                        and a <a href='https://www.amazon.com.au/Nikon-AF-S-85mm-f1-8-G/dp/B006TAP096?th=1'> Nikon 85mm 1.8G </a>
                        fixed focal length lens.
                        I started carrying 2 bodies to all my shoots now that solves two purposes,
                        I can switch between 2 focal lengths and I also have a backup in case one of the bodies give up on me.
                        From here on I kept upgrading and puchasing new lenses, a mirrorless Nikon z6ii, another full frame body, flashes, dual camera straps etc .

                        That is what I have as on the date of writing this article, what I use during a shoot totally depends on the type of shoot,
                        location and of course, my mood.
